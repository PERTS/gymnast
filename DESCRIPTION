Imports_comment: This DESCRIPTION file can specify other packages that are
    required via `Imports:` or that it can optionally use via `Suggests:`.
    Gymnast is opinionated about which packages you should be using, and so
    it places all dependencies under `Imports:`. This may change in the
    future as the package is more widely adopted.
